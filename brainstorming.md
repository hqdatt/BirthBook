## Initial brainstorming ideas
1. App to find bathrooms on campus
2. Sleep tracker app
3. Birthday tracker app
4. Pokedex App
5. App that helps with productivity
6. Books app

## Evaluation of top 3 ideas
1. App to find bathrooms on campus: need an API of bathroom on campus (hard). I want to integrate user interaction too so I need Firebase (I haven't learned this yet).
2. Birthday tracker app: Similar to Contact app of Apple but more tailored to tracking friends' birthday
3. Pokedex App: Easy to implement, a lot of API available, but not unique

## Final app idea chosen
Birthday tracker app
